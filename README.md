**# Hello world!**

Thank you for viewing my profile!

I'm Karolina, Front-end Passionate! ðŸ–¤ðŸ’»ðŸ–¤

I will be MEng in Aviation soon âœˆ

I a hard-working person who value learning from others. I enjoy solving problems. Throughout my career, my intellectual curiosity drives me to be a lifelong learner, so actually I find my interest in the Front-end Development branch of IT. So, I took HTML, CSS and JavaScript curses. Currently getting to know frameworks JS and React.js. It is exciting how the front-end constantly changes meaning that you need to keep up and develop along with it.
